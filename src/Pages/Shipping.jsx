                    a product provided it is in fully resalable condition. Returns should be made within 
                    15 days and in original, undamaged packaging. If we find that the product has not 
                    been returned to us in fully resalable condition, we reserve the right to refuse a 
                    refund/exchange on the item. We will refund the price of the item to the purchaser's 
                    account as store credits. A refund of the delivery charge will be given in the 
                    instance of incorrect, damaged or faulty goods
